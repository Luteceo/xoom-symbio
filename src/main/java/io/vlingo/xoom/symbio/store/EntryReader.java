/**
 * The {@code Entry<T>} reader for a given storage type. The specific storage type provides its typed instance.
 * This reads sequentially over all {@code Entry<T>} instances in the entire storage, from the
 * first written {@code Entry<T>} to the current last written {@code Entry<T>}, and is prepared to read
 * all newly appended {@code Entry<T>} instances beyond that point when they become available.
 * <p>
 * The {@code EntryReader} implementor may choose to provide the optional "gap prevention." Gaps
 * may occur in databases that support sequences or auto-increment columns used as a total ordering
 * for the {@code Journal} or other {@code Entry<T>} store. This happens when a sequenced value is
 * obtained, but the table row inserts are not serialized in the same order. The threads inserting
 * race to the physical writes, causing logical ordering with gaps for small time windows. Thus, a
 * range query may see gaps in the sequences if run during inserts at the tail of the table rows.
 * Performing gap prevention involves time-delayed retries, allowing the database inserts to fill
 * the gaps caused by thread races. The gaps are easy to detect, but since they may also be caused
 * by transactions that roll back where with sequence values that are wasted/lost, following the
 * number of retries with time delays the reader should still provide results with gaps. This
 * recognizes that following best effort the gaps may never close, and thus be warranted.
 *
 * @param <T> the concrete type of {@code Entry<T>} stored and read, which maybe be String, byte[], or Object
